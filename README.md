# slb-sv-scraper

Automates various interactions with Schlumberger's Supply Chain (SV)
Portal.

Note that, due to the lack of any sort of API, this is accomplished via
replaying requests in the format seen when interacting with the site in
a browser and screen scraping the results. As such it's liable to be
quite brittle and has been written with a view to "fail fast" rather
than deal with anything slightly anomalous.

Any failing request will result in an error being raised using the
[Slingshot](https://github.com/scgilardi/slingshot) library `throw+`
method. The resulting exception will contain the full HTTP response to
aid in debugging.

## Usage

Add the library to your `project.clj` dependencies:

```clojure
:dependencies [["slb-sv-scraper" "0.1.0"]]
```

Create a session and retrieve an order, print the number of lines:

```clojure
(ns slb-download
  (:require [slb-sv-scraper.session :refer [with-scraper-session]]
            [slb-sv-scraper.order :as order])

(with-scraper-session [s "username" "password"]
  (let [o (order/get-order s "123456")]
    (println (count o))))
```

Retrieve the BOM for the first item on the order and print a nested map
of the components actually used in the build:

```clojure
(ns slb-download
  (:require [slb-sv-scraper.session :refer [with-scraper-session]]
            [slb-sv-scraper.order :as order]
            [slb-sv-scraper.item :as item]
            [slb-sv-scraper.bom-util :as bu]
            [clojure.pprint :refer [pprint])

(with-scraper-session [s "username" "password"]
  (let [o (order/get-order s "123456")
        b (item/get-bom s (-> o first (get "ItemID")))]
    (pprint (bu/filter-by-useable b))))
```
